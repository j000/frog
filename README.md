1. When the frog jumps it randomly chooses from the possible landing places.

2. The frog keeps jumping until it crosses the river.

3. What is the expected number of jumps for different river widths?

This simulations does exactly that. Jumps to random position until it reaches other river bank. Then calculate average numer of jumps.
